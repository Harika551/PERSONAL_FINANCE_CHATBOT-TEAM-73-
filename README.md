# PERSONAL_FINANCE_CHATBOT-TEAM-73-
A simple personal-finance dashboard built in Python with Streamlit, pandas, and Plotly. It lets you record income, expenses, and stock holdings, then shows cash-flow and portfolio performance in real time. Optionally, you can connect a finance-tuned LLaMA model via Ollama for natural-language insights.
